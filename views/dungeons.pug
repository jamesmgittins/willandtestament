    h4 Dungeon Information
    p Dungeon solo mode is activated when entering an instance without being in a party or raid.
    p Enemy health and damage will be scaled down to allow solo play. Elite mobs outside of dungeon entrances will not be scaled, so entrance may be difficult.
    p This only applies to 5 man dungeons, and not raids.
    p Perma death still applies when inside a dungeon either solo or in a party. So be careful.
